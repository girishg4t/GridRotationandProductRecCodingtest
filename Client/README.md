This is the UI project for the 2nd test (Product Recommendation) given by Inheritx

To start the project 
1) npm install
2) npm start

Note: it is listening to server on port 8000

I have created a common component for Customer information and httpHelper for making an api call.

this project is based on my sample project (this is my personal git repository)

1) Validation need to be implemented
2) Need to correct console errors and warning
